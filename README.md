Grammar for the (terrible) ProRealTime (almost) Basic language for VS Code

## Language Features

Almost none, no conditonal jumps just conditional branching, no labels or in fact anything that might be considered a *standard* language feature as seen in the last what, 50 years?

Even `6502` has labels and `JNE`'s anyway, more of an exercise in custom grammers for VS Code.

If you feel the need to use an unstable platform and write complex logic using nothing more than `IF x THEN ... ENDIF` with a rats nest of flags then this is for you (if I ever finish it).
